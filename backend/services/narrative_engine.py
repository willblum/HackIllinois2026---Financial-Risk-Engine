"""
Narrative Routing Engine
========================
Decides whether an incoming story updates an existing narrative direction
or spawns a new one, then persists the result to ChromaDB.

Two entry points:

    ingest_story(headline, body)
        All-in-one: embeds the story itself, then routes. Use for single
        manual ingests where you don't need batch efficiency.

    route_with_embedding(headline, body, embedding)
        Routing only — embedding is supplied externally. Use this when
        the caller has already batch-embedded a set of stories via
        embed_batch() for efficiency (the /api/pipeline/process flow).

Routing rule (cosine distance in [0, 2]):
    distance < NEW_NARRATIVE_THRESHOLD  → update existing narrative
    distance >= NEW_NARRATIVE_THRESHOLD → create new narrative direction

    """
    Multi-signal surprise scorer.  Zero latency, no network calls.

    Surprise is built from five independent signals:

      1. Distance base  — how far the story sits from the nearest narrative
         centroid.  Two-segment scale keeps updates and creates in natural
         sub-ranges, leaving headroom for the correction signals below.
           Updates  (d < threshold): [0.02, 0.60]
           Creates  (d >= threshold): [0.60, 0.85]

      2. Shock language — explicit linguistic markers that the author flagged
         as unexpected ("unprecedented", "sudden", "surprise", "reversal", …).
         Each hit adds +0.08, capped at +0.20.

      3. Magnitude language — superlatives and records signal a bigger-than-
         expected event ("record", "all-time", "40-year high", "fastest ever").
         Each hit adds +0.06, capped at +0.15.

      4. Staleness bonus — a story that re-activates a dormant narrative is
         inherently more surprising than one arriving in an active feed.
         +0.03 (>12h)  →  +0.07 (>48h)  →  +0.12 (>7 days).

      5. Inversion bonus — if the new story's directional tone contradicts the
         narrative's established trend (surge story into a dropping narrative,
         or crash story into a calm one), add +0.08–0.10.

      Maturity dampening: high event_count narratives (well-understood by
      the market) get their distance base dampened by up to 25%.  Explicit
      shock/magnitude signals are NOT dampened — a record event is still
      record regardless of how long the narrative has been tracked.

    Impact — unchanged keyword-count scorer with diminishing returns.
    Range: ~0.04 (no signal) → 1.0 (multiple high-severity hits).
