A "narrative direction" is a broad, ongoing real-world theme that can drive market model breakdown.
Examples:
  - "Energy supply shock" — ongoing constraints on energy availability affecting markets
  - "Regional banking stress" — deteriorating confidence in mid-size banks
  - "China trade policy tightening" — escalating restrictions on China-US trade
  - "Sovereign debt pressure" — rising concern about government default risk

A narrative direction is NOT a specific event. It is the underlying story arc.

Given the news story below, identify which narrative direction it belongs to.
